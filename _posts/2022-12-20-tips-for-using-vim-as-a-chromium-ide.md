There are lots of powerful IDEs which are broadly used by developers. Vim is a
text editor, but it can be turned into a good IDE with awesome plugins and a
little bit of configuration.

Many people already prefer using Vim to develop software because of its
lightness and availability. I am one of them, and always use Vim to develop
Chromium. However, someone would think that itâ€™s hard to get Vim to reach the
same performance as other IDEs, since Chromium is a very huge project.

For those potential users, this post introduces some tips for using Vim as a
Chromium IDE.

## Code Formatting
I strongly recommend using [vim-codefmt][3] for code formatting. It supports
most file types in Chromium including GN (See [GN docs][4]) and autoformatting.
However, I don't like to use autoformatting and just bind `:FormatLines` to
`ctrl-I` for formating a selected visual block.

## tools/vim

You can easily find a bunch of vim files in [tools/vim][1]. I create a *.vimrc*
file locally in a working directory and load only what I need.

```sh
let chtool_path=getcwd().'/tools'

filetype off
let &rtp.=','.chtool_path.'/vim/mojom'
exec 'source' chtool_path.'/vim/filetypes.vim'
exec 'source' chtool_path.'/vim/ninja-build.vim'
filetype plugin indent on
```

Chromium provides vimscript files for syntax highliting and file detection of
Mojom, which is the IDL for Mojo interfaces (IPC) among Chromium services. And
`ninja-build.vim` allows you compile a file with `ctrl-O` or build the specific
target with `:CrBuild` command. See each vim files for details.

### YouCompleteMe

[tools/vim][1] has an example configuration for [YouCompleteMe][8] (a code
completion engine for Vim). See [tools/vim/chromium.ycm_extra_conf.py][10].

```sh
let g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist = ['../.ycm_extra_conf.py']
let g:ycm_goto_buffer_command = 'split-or-existing-window'
```

As you already know, YouCompleteMe requires clangd. Very fortunately, Chromium
already supports clangd and remote index server to get daily index snapshots.

Do not skip documents about [using Clangd to build chromium][2] and [chromium
remote index server][9].

Here are short demos for completion suggestions,

and code jumping(`:YcmCompleter GoTo`, `:YcmCompleter GoToReferences`) during
Chromium development.

## Commenter

A good developer writes good comments, so being a good commenter makes you a
good developer (joke). In my humble opinion, [NERD commenter][5] will make you a
good developer (joke again). You can get all details from the docs of NERD
commenter, and Chromium needs only an additional option for mojom.

```sh
let g:NERDCustomDelimiters = { 'mojom': {'left': '//'} }
```

## File navigation

Chromium is really huge, so we benefit from efficient file navigation tools.
There are lots of awesome fuzzy finder plugins for this purpose and I have been
using [command-t][6] for a long time. But command-t requires a vim executable
with ruby/lua support or Neovim. If you need a simpler yet still powerful
navigator, [fzf.vim][7] is an altenative great option.

Since Chromium a the git project, search commands based by `git ls-files` will
provide results very quickly. Use the option `let g:CommandTFileScanner = 'git'`
for `command-t`, and use the command `:GFiles` for `fzf.vim`.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading and I hope this blog post can be some help to your
development enviroment for Chromium. Any comment for sharing some other cool
tips always be welcomed, so that we can make our vim more productive.

.... I will be back someday with debugging Chromium in Vim.
